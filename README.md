# GNBSI
Genomic analysis of gram negative isolates associated with bloodstream infections and positive CPE swabs, collected from across the UK in 2023-2024.

# Prepare Pilot analysis workflow 
Prepare workflow to compare hybrid, short and long read sequencing assemblies, to verifiy validity of using long-read only assemblies for main project.

# Perform pilot analysis 
Compare quality of assemblies from hybrid (Unicycler), Long-read only with long read polishing (Flye-Medakax1), long-read only wiht short-read polishing, and short-read only (Shovill).
